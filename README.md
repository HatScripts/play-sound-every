### CodePen version
Also hosted [on CodePen](https://codepen.io/HatScripts/full/VXEyVB) but this version has a caveat: It must<b>*</b> be viewed within an iframe so neither the page title nor the favicon can be changed, thus the following do not work:
* Animated emoji clock in the page title
* Potential future features such as custom animated favicons

<b>*</b> A way around this is to use [debug mode](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/views/debug-view/), which requires at minimum a [CodePen account](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free).
1. [Log in](https://codepen.io/login) to your CodePen account
2. Make a fork of [the pen](https://codepen.io/HatScripts/pen/VXEyVB)
3. View your forked pen in debug mode

__Tip:__ If you have _CodePen PRO_ you can just view the original pen in debug mode.
